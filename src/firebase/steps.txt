//get data from firestore

see shop-page.component.jsx for reference:

1. have an unsubscribe var defined
2. since we only want to get the data once while app load 
    or when any data is altered
    -> write componentDidMount()
    -> get the collection reference by where 'collections' is the name of the collection defined in firestore
        const collectionRef = firestore.collection('collections')
    -> now get data base on collectionRef
        so collectionRef.onSnapshot()
